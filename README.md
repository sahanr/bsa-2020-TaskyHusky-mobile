# BSA 2020 | TaskyHusky Mobile
**[TaskyHusky](https://github.com/BinaryStudioAcademy/bsa-2020-TaskyHusky)** is a tool used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. It is similar to JIRA and Trello. It allows users to keep track of everything - from the big picture to the minute details. The visual boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card.
